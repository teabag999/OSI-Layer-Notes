# Difference between Attackers

1. **Internal Attackers**
   - May pose a greater risk due to their level of legitimate access to systems and resources.

2. **External Attackers**

---

# Level of Sophistication

- **Lone Wolf Attacker**
- **Script Kiddies**
  - Easily defeated with basic security controls such as regular patching, endpoint security software, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems.
- **Hacktivists**
  - Seek to use hacking skills to advance a political or social agenda.
- **Criminal Syndicate/Organized Crime**
  - Primarily for financial gains.
- **Corporate Espionage**
  - Attacks against competitors.

# Access to Resources

- **Nation States**
  - Attacks to put national interests forward, targeting both other governments and individuals with resources.

---

# Motivation

- **White Hat Hackers**
  - Work with full permission of the target.
- **Black Hat Hackers**
  - Hack with malicious intent without permission.
- **Grey Hat Hackers**
  - Fit somewhere in the middle, engaging in usually illegal activities.

# Preventing Insider Attacks

Insider threats are the most dangerous within an organization, where trusted individuals exploit their privileged access to systems to steal information or cause damage. Over half of all organizations have experienced a security breach, and in 2/3 of cases, these breaches were more costly to remediate than external attacks. Privilege escalation attacks can transform normal users' credentials into powerful superuser accounts. To protect against insider attacks, organizations should perform background checks on potential employees, follow the principle of least privilege, use two-person control for sensitive transactions, and implement a mandatory vacation policy for critical staff. Organizations must also be vigilant for signs of insider misuse and design security systems to limit the impact of rogue insiders.

# Attack Vectors

Before an attacker can gain access to our systems or networks, they need to find an initial way in. Attack vectors are the paths that attackers use to gain that initial access.

## Common Types of Attack Vectors:

1. **Email**
   - Phishing links and messages containing malicious attachments and links.

2. **Social Media**
   - Used to spread malware or as part of influence campaigns designed to gain the trust of users who can be tricked into granting unauthorized access to information and systems.

3. **Removable Media**
   - 

4. **Magnetic Stripe Cards**
   - 

5. **Cloud Service**
   - Attackers scan cloud services for files with improper access controls, systems that have security flaws, or accidentally published API keys or passwords.

# Zero Days and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

Organizations often fail to apply security patches, leaving them vulnerable to attackers who can exploit the missing patch. To protect their systems, organizations should apply security updates as soon as they are available from operating system and application vendors. However, not all vulnerabilities are known, and zero-day vulnerabilities are a type of vulnerability that can be used to gain access to systems.

When a security researcher discovers a new vulnerability, they typically handle it ethically and responsibly, notifying the vendor responsible for the vulnerability and giving them the opportunity to fix it before publicly disclosing the vulnerability. This process covers thousands of newly discovered vulnerabilities each year. However, if someone decides to keep the vulnerability secret, they preserve it as a secret weapon used to gain access to systems. This is known as a zero-day vulnerability.

It is not easy to exploit a zero-day vulnerability, as it requires knowledge of the vulnerability and the tools and skills required to exploit it. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are well-funded and highly skilled attackers who use zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise the security of any typical organization. Defending against APTs is difficult, as it is difficult for small businesses or large ones to stand up technically to the resources of a well-funded government agency.

To protect an organization to some extent, organizations can implement strong security measures, including strong encryption and rigorous monitoring, to ensure sensitive data can withstand an APT attack. By doing so, organizations can better protect their systems and systems from potential threats.
