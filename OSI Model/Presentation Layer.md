![The Presentation Layer: encryption, compression, translation](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/19L86neKKT8srUkOSe4rf7/ff4c91c94a1790651df7b48433913f59/osi_model_presentation_layer_6.png "The Presentation Layer")

This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume. The presentation layer is responsible for translation, [encryption](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/), and compression of data.

Two communicating devices communicating may be using different encoding methods, so layer 6 is responsible for translating incoming data into a syntax that the application layer of the receiving device can understand.

If the devices are communicating over an encrypted connection, layer 6 is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender’s end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver's end so that it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.

Finally the presentation layer is also responsible for compressing data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to layer 5. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of communication by minimizing the amount of data that will be transferred.
