The

The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the senderâ€™s device, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as routing. Network layer protocols include IP, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), the Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP), and the IPsec suite.
