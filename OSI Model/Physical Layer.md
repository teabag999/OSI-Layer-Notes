![The Physical Layer: sending cable, bitstream, receiving cable](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/1HQ1W5P4XAinIdM37DTu4U/900ccdceda346baf03ce8b9f977d2974/osi_model_physical_layer_1.png "The Physical Layer")

This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables andÂ [switches](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-network-switch/). This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.
