![The Data Link Layer: frame creation, frames sent between networks](https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/3TLHavXiotb9ayyZFKECf3/9456d1c431cd71ceea7f4b407f076f11/data_link_layer_osi_model.png "The Data Link Layer")

The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the _same_ network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames. Like the network layer, the data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication (The transport layer only does flow control and error control for inter-network communications).
